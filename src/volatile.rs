//!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! This is a copy of the vcell crate at: [https://github.com/japaric/vcell]()
//! as well as the volatile-register crate at: [https://github.com/rust-embedded/volatile-register]()
//! We decided to copy the code instead of adding a dependency to the crate because it is a small crate and we want to avoid adding dependencies to the project.
//!------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//! Just like [`Cell`] but with [volatile] read / write operations
//!
//! [`Cell`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html
//! [volatile]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/fn.read_volatile.html

//! Volatile access to memory mapped hardware registers
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ``` no_run
//! use volatile_register::RW;
//!
//! // Create a struct that represents the memory mapped register block
//! /// Nested Vector Interrupt Controller
//! #[repr(C)]
//! pub struct Nvic {
//!     /// Interrupt Set-Enable
//!     pub iser: [RW<u32>; 8],
//!     reserved0: [u32; 24],
//!     /// Interrupt Clear-Enable
//!     pub icer: [RW<u32>; 8],
//!     reserved1: [u32; 24],
//!     // .. more registers ..
//! }
//!
//! // Access the registers by casting the base address of the register block
//! // to the previously declared `struct`
//! let nvic = 0xE000_E100 as *const Nvic;
//! // Unsafe because the compiler can't verify the address is correct
//! unsafe { (*nvic).iser[0].write(1) }
//! ```
